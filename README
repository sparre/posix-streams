POSIX Streams [1]
=================

The package `POSIX_Stream` allows you to treat a POSIX file descriptor (of
type `POSIX.IO.File_Descriptor` as a descendant of
`Ada.Streams.Root_Stream_Type`.  This means that you can use the Ada stream
attributes (`'Write`, `'Read`, `'Output` and `'Input`) to transmit objects
to and from a stream opened as a POSIX file.


Included tests
--------------

The repository comes with three test cases:

1) `streaming_tagged_records` - shows how tagged records can be streamed from
   standard output through a pipe and standard input.

2) `unused_units` - warns about units which aren't compiled.
